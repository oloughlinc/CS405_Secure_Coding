# Reflection

These projects have strengthened my appreciation for software security and have helped me to better understand the importance of including security measures at every step during development, along with implementing a secure architecture for deployment and controlling access in the long term.

	Working through a coding standard has also helped me to see just how many vulnerabilities can arise when working with a low-level language like C/C++. Exploring the CERT C recommendations can be overwhelming but each and every vulnerability is based in some sort of realistic scenario. 
	
	Another thing I have learned in conjunction with this is the importance of static analysis tools. They can perform better than the IDE/compiler alone to detect tricky issues before they become a problem, and are quick and simple to use. If nothing else, it will improve the quality of my code to use these.
	
	I have learned the damage that can arise from failing to implement security standards and examined some real life cases where data was stolen, and why exactly these occurred. I think one of the main takeaways in these cases are that, although every company is a possible target for security attacks, in each case there is always something more that the breached company could have done to prevent the attack. It showcases the importance of involving a tight security framework in every aspect and practicing Defense in Depth.
	
	Finally, I better understand the concept of authentication, authorization, and accounting, the Triple A framework, and why this is the foundation of security in a zero-trust policy. Along with this, zero-trust policies are and will continue to be important in the face of increasingly complex network infrastructure and increasingly complex cyber security risks. Isolating resources, providing strong authentication services, and default deny are important considerations now and for the future of software security.
